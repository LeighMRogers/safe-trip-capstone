# Safe Trip: An App for Travelers

## Project Overview

After a natural or human-made disaster, humanitarian aid workers often provide relief or development to people in some of the most unstable and unsafe places in the world, often at the last minute. Because of these challenges, they often lack access to information they need to keep themselves and their aid recipients safe. Casual tourists also want to stay safe in a foreign country or research the safety of a country as they plan travel.

To solve these issues, this app provides users with real-time travel advisories for any country. It also seeks to serve as a portal for creating itineraries for trips that include country advisories. These itineraries are postable, editable, and deletable.

## Challenge Statement

How might we inform global travelers of country-specific safety advisories during trip planning and travel?
