# Safe Trip: An App for Travelers

After a natural or human-made disaster, humanitarian aid workers often provide relief or development to people in some of the most unstable and unsafe places in the world, often at the last minute. Because of these challenges, they often lack access to information they need to keep themselves and their aid recipients safe.

This app aims to provide these users, or any global traveler, with the latest real-time travel information on any country one seeks to visit, including travel advisories, vaccination suggestions, and embassy contact details. It also seeks to serve as a portal for creating itineraries for trips that include the latest safety advisories, since often areas become dangerous and one must take extra precautions even while in country. These itineraries should be postable, editable, and deletable.

With these main functionalities, I hope to create a product that offers users a helpful trip planning tool where safety is the main priority.
